This is different from other states of consciousness, such as wakefulness, coma, or disorders of consciousness, because sleep still involves active brain patterns and the ability to react to stimuli, albeit to a lesser extent. Sleep is characterized by repeating periods of REM and non-REM sleep, and it serves important functions for overall health and well-being.\n",
